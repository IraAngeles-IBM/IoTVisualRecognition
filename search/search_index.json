In this example node-red is used to create an image upload form which sends the image to IBM Visual Recognition and trigger an iot device whenever fire is detected in the image. Login/signup in to your IBM Cloud Account Goto Catalog and create the following services: Install Node-RED NOTE : Please follow the tutorial to install Node-RED in IBM Cloud Create IBM Cloud Service Internet of Things Platform NOTE : You need to create the A Platform Starter App,not Internet of things Platform service.I suggest you use the link above to quickly avoid confusion.
